# Security Implementation Summary

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Protection**: Comprehensive input sanitization removes script tags, event handlers, and suspicious content
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Pattern detection for common SQL injection attempts
- **URL Validation**: Strict URL validation preventing data URIs and suspicious schemes
- **UUID Validation**: Proper UUID format validation for all resource IDs
- **Service Account Validation**: Multi-layer validation for Google service account JSON files

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **Resource Ownership**: All endpoints verify user ownership of resources
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user rate limiting prevents abuse (10 requests/hour for sensitive operations)
- **Failed Auth Tracking**: Monitors and blocks IPs after repeated failed attempts
- **JWT Validation**: Proper token validation with security event logging

### 3. Security Headers & Network Protection
- **Content Security Policy**: Restrictive CSP preventing XSS and content injection
- **Security Headers**: Complete set including X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper origin validation and request filtering
- **CSRF Protection**: State-changing operations protected against CSRF attacks

### 4. Data Protection
- **Encryption Service**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data at rest
- **Environment Variables**: All credentials moved to secure environment configuration
- **Secure Token Storage**: Access tokens encrypted before database storage
- **Data Sanitization**: Sensitive data removed from logs and responses

### 5. Advanced Threat Protection
- **Vulnerability Scanner Detection**: Automatic detection and blocking of security scanners
- **Brute Force Protection**: IP-based blocking after suspicious activity
- **Request Anomaly Detection**: Monitoring for unusual request patterns
- **Security Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security events

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting
- **Security Audit System**: Real-time monitoring of security events
- **Suspicious Activity Tracking**: IP-based tracking of malicious behavior
- **Secure Logging**: Sanitized logging preventing credential exposure
- **Automated Cleanup**: Periodic cleanup of security data
