# Security Implementation Guide

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Protection
- **Removed all hardcoded credentials** from source code
- **Created proper .env structure** with server-side and client-side separation
- **Added environment validation** at server startup
- **Updated .env.example** with secure placeholder values

### 2. Client-Side Security
- **Frontend variables** (VITE_* prefixed) contain only public-safe values
- **Authentication state management** with proper session handling
- **Protected routes** - all dashboard routes require authentication
- **Automatic redirects** for unauthorized access attempts

### 3. Server-Side Security
- **Security headers middleware** with comprehensive protection:
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevents clickjacking)
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (prevents MIME sniffing)
  - X-XSS-Protection: enabled with blocking mode
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Content-Security-Policy: restrictive policy for SPA
  - Removed X-Powered-By header
  
- **Rate limiting** implemented:
  - 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
  - Automatic cleanup of rate limit data
  - Proper error responses with retry-after headers

- **Request payload limits**:
  - JSON payload limited to 10MB
  - URL-encoded payload limited to 10MB

- **Sensitive data sanitization**:
  - Service account and auth endpoints have sanitized logging
  - Prevents sensitive data exposure in logs

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with Supabase
- **Token-based API protection** on all endpoints
- **User context validation** in middleware
- **Proper error handling** for unauthorized requests

### 5. Database Security
- **Environment-based database connections**
- **Separate connection strings** for different environments
- **No hardcoded database credentials**

## Environment Variables Structure

### Server-Side Only (Never exposed to client)
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://connection-string
```

### Client-Side (Exposed to browser)
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Security Best Practices Followed

### ✅ Implemented
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [x] Environment variable validation
- [x] Security headers on all responses
- [x] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [x] Payload size limits
- [x] Authentication required for all dashboard access
- [x] Sensitive data sanitization in logs
- [x] Client/server separation for environment variables

### ✅ Already in Place
- [x] Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- [x] JWT token validation on protected routes
- [x] User session management
- [x] CORS configuration
- [x] Error handling without information disclosure

## Deployment Security Notes

### Production Environment
- Source maps are disabled by default in Vite build
- All API keys are loaded from environment variables
- Database connections use pooled connections for performance
- All routes are protected with proper authentication

### Development Environment
- Environment variables loaded from .env file
- Development-only features properly isolated
- Hot reloading doesn't expose sensitive data

## Security Monitoring

### Rate Limiting
- API endpoints monitor request frequency
- Automatic blocking of excessive requests
- Configurable limits per endpoint

### Authentication Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts logged
- Session management with automatic cleanup
- Token expiration handling

## Recommendations for Enhanced Security

1. **Enable Supabase RLS** on all tables
2. **Regular security audits** of dependencies
3. **Monitor API usage** for unusual patterns
4. **Regular credential rotation** for service accounts
5. **Implement IP whitelisting** for admin functions if needed
6. **Use HTTPS only** in production
7. **Regular backup** of database with encryption

## Emergency Procedures

If credentials are compromised:
1. Immediately rotate all Supabase keys
2. Update .env file with new credentials
3. Restart application server
4. Review access logs for unauthorized usage
5. Update any stored service account credentials

## Security Testing

Regular security checks should include:
- Environment variable validation
- Authentication bypass testing
- Rate limiting verification
- CORS policy testing
- XSS prevention validation
- SQL injection testing (though Drizzle ORM provides protection)
