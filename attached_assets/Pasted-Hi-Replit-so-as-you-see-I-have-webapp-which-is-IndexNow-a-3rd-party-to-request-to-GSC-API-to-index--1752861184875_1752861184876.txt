Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

Also keep in your fucking mind, that this project isn't use Postgress local database, it's using Supabase as the database, so DO NOT install db locally and pust any DB changes in the local system. If I ask for updates, changes, enhancement that may affect on the DB things then give the SQL queries for me to run on Supabase SQL editor.

For now, as the webapp is have feature to send an email for jobs that compeleted, failed and usage monitoring. But, the email template still using not fucking email that I want and still have some problem which is:
1. The subject isn't right "IndexNow Job Completed: 7" make it more interesting and use correct job name
2. The information on the email is wrong (idk why it's can get the correct info) and not right-formatted (it's should be space evenly)
URLs Indexed0
Failed URLs7
Total URLsundefined

So, made a changes, fix that error and use this template. This template is still not ready for the project, but I want use this html template, so make the wording and the details (change it), change the logo (from env), I want exactly like this template.
