Hi Replit, so as you see I have webapp which is IndexNow a 3rd party to request to GSC API to index a link. This webapp is same and inspirated by Instant Indexing wordpress plugin by RankMath.

So, as this webapp is on development stage and for personal use only. I need you to focus to enhance and fix some problem in dashboard and panel.

Before you do make the changes, I need you to do a deep dive into the codebase, so you do have better understanding about this webapp, the current stage and feature and the obstacles.

I also want you to pay attention that this project isn't using postgress db locally or any local db, so stupid install localdb and push to it. This project is use Supabase, so if i ask for enhancement that affect on database, just give me the SQL queries for me to run.

Then, i need you to find the issue and fix this issue. When I run npm run dev it's completely working well. But, when i do run build (npm run build) and the build is complete and success and I run npm start and open the page, it's just show white blank.

When I look view source and network tree, i saw completely all running.

The network tree also show that page, css and js is completely loaded without an error.

Then from a lot changes in here and there from previous testing, you always say that the error is on "import.meta.dirname" which you lots mention that and change that but neither is work, so I'm not sure does the problem really on there or not.

Then, you asking me to run:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://bwkasvyrzbzhcdtvsbyg.supabase.co VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJ3a2FzdnlyemJ6aGNkdHZzYnlnIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTI3NTUxNDIsImV4cCI6MjA2ODMzMTE0Mn0._YnFB_X6glA_67HRBcPQIVJ0lzcOQ5PinZzilecvB98 vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist --define:import.meta.dirname=\"$(pwd)/dist\"

NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js

So, the problem is related to that command.

Then somehow it's success and the production is show correct things, not just white blank page. Then my question is:
1. Why I need to run that? Why i just can run normal command like npm run build, npm start, npm start dev, and also the variable like supabase url and key is already I put on the .env and if I just run normal command like npm run build and npm start it's not working bcs the page just give white blank page
2. Then I saw in index.js, you hardcoded like the directory "/home/runner/workspace/dist" this is just your working enviroment, what if I move the webapp to another enviroment or run it in my own server, will I do need to change all of this, which this is will be taking time and not flexible at all.
