# Google Indexing Dashboard

## Read everything in this section carefully, this is important things about this project ##
- In this project, we're using Supabase for the database, auth management, and cloud storage. So, DO NOT install PostgreSQL locally and push any database locally. Give the SQL queries if you need to push/updates a database related.
- All variables like key, endpoint or anything that related to it, must be placed in .env file. DO NOT hardcoded any variables key in the code file.

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that provides an instant indexing solution similar to RankMath's Instant Indexing plugin. The application allows users to manage Google service accounts, submit URLs for indexing via Google Search Console API, and schedule automated indexing jobs. It features a clean, professional dashboard with a warm color scheme and collapsible sidebar navigation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
**CRITICAL DATABASE POLICY: SUPABASE ONLY**
- This project uses SUPABASE database exclusively - NO local PostgreSQL, NO local database installation EVER
- Database connection: Supabase PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL environment variable only
- Authentication: JWT-based approach for Google Indexing API with token caching
- NEVER install local PostgreSQL or any local database solutions
- ALL database operations go through Supabase connection string only
